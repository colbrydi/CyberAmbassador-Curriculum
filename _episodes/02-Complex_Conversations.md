## What is "Jargon?"
- According to Google: "Special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand."
- Common sources of jargon
  - Discipline-specific terms
  - Words with multiple meanings
  - Cultural references
  - Idioms
  - Acronyms

# Tool: Reducing Jargon

- Before you speak, think about what might be considered jargon?
  - What is the disciplinary background of the audience?
  - What is the cultural/language background of the audience?
  - What is the level of expertise in the audience?
- Choose whether to explain or eliminate the jargon
  - Explain when understanding the jargon is essential to solving the problem
  - Eliminate when the jargon is secondary to the problem at hand

## What is an analogy?
- According to Google: "A comparison between two things, typically for the purpose of clarification or explanation."

# Tool: Using Good Analogies
- A good analogy
  - Fits the context
  - Increases understanding
- But be cautious!
  - Analogies have inherent limits, and will eventually break down
  - Analogies can cause confusion if they are not understood – beware the cultural reference!

# Tool: Check for Understanding
-As the speaker, your goal is to be understood
-Check for understanding by asking questions that encourage the listener to respond
  -Example: “Whew! I just threw out a lot of information. Would you mind sharing what you think is going on so I can see if my explanation made sense?”
  -Example: “So, what questions do you have about the situation I just described?”
-Avoid yes/no questions (“Do you understand?”)

## Speaker Example: Embarrassingly Parallel
**The Context**
Nan is a graduate student using a software program to analyze experimental data; the program takes approximately 10 minutes per input, but produces the correct results. Nan has a new data set with 10,000 inputs and wants to figure out how to speed things up by running on the university’s supercomputer, but Nan doesn’t have a lot of programming experience and has never used the supercomputing center before.

**The Speaker**
Jamie is a CI Facilitator who works for the university’s supercomputing center. After a quick code review, Jaime can see that Nan’s program can easily be reworked to run in parallel, which will allows multiple inputs to be processed at the same time on the supercomputer and significantly speed up the overall project.

# Jamie’s First Attempt
**Jamie says**:  “I’ve looked though your code and I think you can make it go faster. Your problem is Embarrassingly Parallel. You just need to write a submission script to distribute your program across many nodes. Here is a website to help you get started. That makes sense? Right?”
  - Did Jamie use any Jargon?
  - How well do you think Nan now understands the problem?
  - What response will Nan likely have to this explanation?

# Jamie’s Second Attempt
**Jamie**: “I’ve looked though your code and I think we can make it go faster by running it in parallel.  Do you know what that means?”

**Nan**: “No”

**Jamie**: “This is a type of problem I consider to be pleasantly parallel.  Imagine that each of your inputs needs to make a road trip across the USA. You want them to get to the destination as fast as possible, but you don’t care what order they arrive or whether they take the same roads to get there. Running in parallel is like having many different cars and roads so more of your inputs can go at the same time. We need to write a program to tell the system how to run your inputs on many different computers. What do you think about this plan?"

## Breakout Activity: The “Speaker”
- It’s time to practice the “Speaker” role, using the tools you’ve learned
  - Reducing Jargon
  - Using Good Analogies
  - Checking for Understanding
- For this activity, you will work in groups and rotate through three roles:
  - **The CI Facilitator**: has the role of speaker and initiates the conversation. The CI Facilitator’s  goal is to use the speaker’s tools to successfully communicate the problem described in the scenario.
  - **The Actor**: has the role of listener and responds to the CI Facilitator, following the guidelines given in the scenario. Have fun acting and trying to make the CI Facilitator  use the speaker’s tools appropriately before you “give in” and the scenario ends.
  - **The Coach**: has the role of observing the interactions between the CI Facilitator (speaker) and Actor (listener) and providing feedback to both participants. Coaches are free to look at all three role cards for the scenario, and are encouraged to “pause” the scenario and offer advice to keep things on track.
