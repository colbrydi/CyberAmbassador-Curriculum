## What is "Jargon?"
- According to Google: "Special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand."
- Common sources of jargon
  - Discipline-specific terms
  - Words with multiple meanings
  - Cultural references
  - Idioms
  - Acronyms

# Tool: Reducing Jargon

- Before you speak, think about what might be considered jargon?
  - What is the disciplinary background of the audience?
  - What is the cultural/language background of the audience?
  - What is the level of expertise in the audience?
- Choose whether to explain or eliminate the jargon
  - Explain when understanding the jargon is essential to solving the problem
  - Eliminate when the jargon is secondary to the problem at hand

## What is an analogy?
- According to Google: "A comparison between two things, typically for the purpose of clarification or explanation."

# Tool: Using Good Analogies
- A good analogy
  - Fits the context
  - Increases understanding
- But be cautious!
  - Analogies have inherent limits, and will eventually break down
  - Analogies can cause confusion if they are not understood – beware the cultural reference!

# Tool: Check for Understanding
-As the speaker, your goal is to be understood
-Check for understanding by asking questions that encourage the listener to respond
  -Example: “Whew! I just threw out a lot of information. Would you mind sharing what you think is going on so I can see if my explanation made sense?”
  -Example: “So, what questions do you have about the situation I just described?”
-Avoid yes/no questions (“Do you understand?”)

## Speaker Example: Embarrassingly Parallel
**The Context**
Nan is a graduate student using a software program to analyze experimental data; the program takes approximately 10 minutes per input, but produces the correct results. Nan has a new data set with 10,000 inputs and wants to figure out how to speed things up by running on the university’s supercomputer, but Nan doesn’t have a lot of programming experience and has never used the supercomputing center before.

**The Speaker**
Jamie is a CI Facilitator who works for the university’s supercomputing center. After a quick code review, Jaime can see that Nan’s program can easily be reworked to run in parallel, which will allows multiple inputs to be processed at the same time on the supercomputer and significantly speed up the overall project.

# Jamie’s First Attempt
**Jamie says**:  “I’ve looked though your code and I think you can make it go faster. Your problem is Embarrassingly Parallel. You just need to write a submission script to distribute your program across many nodes. Here is a website to help you get started. That makes sense? Right?”
  - Did Jamie use any Jargon?
  - How well do you think Nan now understands the problem?
  - What response will Nan likely have to this explanation?

# Jamie’s Second Attempt
**Jamie**: “I’ve looked though your code and I think we can make it go faster by running it in parallel.  Do you know what that means?”

**Nan**: “No”

**Jamie**: “This is a type of problem I consider to be pleasantly parallel.  Imagine that each of your inputs needs to make a road trip across the USA. You want them to get to the destination as fast as possible, but you don’t care what order they arrive or whether they take the same roads to get there. Running in parallel is like having many different cars and roads so more of your inputs can go at the same time. We need to write a program to tell the system how to run your inputs on many different computers. What do you think about this plan?"

## Breakout Activity: The “Speaker”
- It’s time to practice the “Speaker” role, using the tools you’ve learned
  - Reducing Jargon
  - Using Good Analogies
  - Checking for Understanding
- For this activity, you will work in groups and rotate through three roles:
  - **The CI Facilitator**: has the role of speaker and initiates the conversation. The CI Facilitator’s  goal is to use the speaker’s tools to successfully communicate the problem described in the scenario.
  - **The Actor**: has the role of listener and responds to the CI Facilitator, following the guidelines given in the scenario. Have fun acting and trying to make the CI Facilitator  use the speaker’s tools appropriately before you “give in” and the scenario ends.
  - **The Coach**: has the role of observing the interactions between the CI Facilitator (speaker) and Actor (listener) and providing feedback to both participants. Coaches are free to look at all three role cards for the scenario, and are encouraged to “pause” the scenario and offer advice to keep things on track.

## LEADING COMPLEX CONVERSATIONS

**Speaker**
- ROLE: initiates the conversation
- GOAL: communicate the problem
- TOOLS:
  - Reducing Jargon
  - Using Good Analogies
  - Checking for Understanding

**Listener**
- ROLE: listens to the speaker
- GOAL: understand the problem
- TOOLS:
  - Reflective / Active Listening
  - Paraphrasing
  - Asking Clarifying Questions

## Tools For the Listener

**As CI Facilitators, when we are in the listener role our goal is to understand the problem so that we can help find solutions**
  - Use Active / Reflective Listening to make sure the speaker feels heard; this is particularly helpful in situations with strong emotion
  - Use Paraphrasing to make sure that you (the listener) truly understand the situation
  - Use Clarifying Questions to obtain additional information you need to help solve the problem

# Tool: Reflective Listening
- Listen with the goal of truly understanding the speaker
  - Pay attention to both words and body language
  - Watch for strong emotions (anger, frustration, worry)
- Reflect back to the speaker what you heard, using “I” statements
  - Correct: “What I understood was…”
  - Incorrect: “You said…”
- If strong emotions are expressed, acknowledge without judgement
  - Correct: “That sounds really frustrating…”
  - Incorrect: “Calm down! You’re blowing this completely out of proportion…”

# Tool: Paraphrasing
- Use paraphrasing when you are trying to understand a complex problem
  1. Listen to the speaker carefully
  2. In your own words, state the parts of the situation you understand (avoid adding jargon!)
  3. Allow the speaker to confirm, or to clarify, your understanding
- Paraphrasing is NOT the same as parroting
  - To use an analogy: paraphrasing is a lens,
while parroting is a mirror

# Tool: Ask Clarifying Questions
- As the listener, your goal is to understand in order to help solve problems
- Use clarifying questions to obtain additional information you need to help
   - “What programming language does your software use?”
   - “Can you tell me a bit more about the team that designed the part?”
   - “Have you ever used this approach before?”

#Listener Example: Frustrated Intern
**The Context**
Dana is a PI who stopped by HPC office hours.  Researcher-facing CI-Professional Kim is there, and listens as Dana says:

“I am SO frustrated! I have a lot of data I need to process using the Sanborn-Stratta method, which is better than the more common FCFD approach. However, my transient error is much larger than the latent error.  I think I can reduce the transient error by increasing the Tallholm threshold, but then the software will not run on my computer.  So, I need you to make it run on the supercomputer!”

**How should Kim respond?**

## Breakout Activity: The “Listener”

  - Active / Reflective Listening
  - Paraphrasing
  - Asking Clarifying Questions
For this activity, you will work in groups and rotate through three roles:

  - **The Coach**: has the role of observing the interactions between the CI Facilitator (listener) and Actor (speaker) and providing feedback to both participants. Coachers are free to look at all three role cards for the scenario, and are encouraged to “pause” the scenario and offer advice to keep things on track.

# Breakout Session
- Break out into groups of 3 (if necessary, groups of 4 can have 2 coaches)
- Pick roles for the first example (CI Facilitator, Actor and Coach)
- Read YOUR ROLE (note that Coaches may want to read all three roles for context)
  - Go to: https://tinyurl.com/ACIpractice
  - Choose the Second Breakout link, then the first example, then your role
- Do the rehearsal exercises
  1. The CI-Professional (speaker) starts the scenario, and the Actor responds
  2. The Coach provides advice as needed, and offers feedback at the end
  3. Afterwards, rotate roles and try the next scenario
  4. There are three (3) practice scenarios; try to rotate roles at least once, but given our limited time today it may not be possible to get through all 3 scenarios
- Come back here for a large group discussion at the end of the breakout session
