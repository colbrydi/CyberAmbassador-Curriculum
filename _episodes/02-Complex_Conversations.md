# Tool: Reducing Jargon

-Before you speak, think about what might be considered jargon?
  - What is the disciplinary background of the audience?
  - What is the cultural/language background of the audience?
  - What is the level of expertise in the audience?
- Choose whether to explain or eliminate the jargon
  - Explain when understanding the jargon is essential to solving the problem
  - Eliminate when the jargon is secondary to the problem at hand

## What is an analogy?
- According to Google: "A comparison between two things, typically for the purpose of clarification or explanation.""

# Tool: Using Good Analogies
- A good analogy
  - Fits the context
  - Increases understanding
- But be cautious!
  - Analogies have inherent limits, and will eventually break down
  - Analogies can cause confusion if they are not understood â€“ beware the cultural reference!
