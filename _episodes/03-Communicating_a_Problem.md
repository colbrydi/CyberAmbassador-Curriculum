### Communication Style is Important
We form unconscious opinions about people based on their communication styles.

- Accent
- Culture
- Pitch of voice
- Speed and pacing
- Pausing to allow others to speak

We tend to like people with communication styles similar to our own.

“Many of our motives, so obvious to us,
are never perceived by the people we talk to.
Many instances of rudeness, stubbornness, inconsiderateness, or refusal to cooperate are really caused by differences in conversational style.”

~ Deborah Tannen

## Tools for Communication about Problems
### Effective communication requires **shared context**

### Ability problems
- "I can't do this"
  - Lack of resources
  - Lack of knowledge
  - Lack of skills
  - Lack of experience
- Avoid misdiagnosis
  - Do not assume you understand the source of the problem
  - Ask for ideas
  - Listen carefully - is this truly an ability problem?
  - Work collaboratively to identify a solution

### Effective communication requires **shared motivation**

### Motivational problems
- "I don't want to do this"
  - Inconvenient
  - Undesirable
  - Difficult
  - Boring
- Communicate consequences
  - Natural consequences (Impersonal ----------> Personal)
  - Imposed consequences
  - Follow up

### What are interpersonal problems?

## Mirroring Activity
- Form two lines and face each other
- Designate one line the leaders; the other line follows
- Mirroring everything from the waist up
- Switch roles of lines
- Have one line rotate

### Why is mirroring valuable?
- An effort to match communication styles with your partner
- Body language mirroring can build trust and put people to ease
- Psychological impact: mirroring is an unconscious form of agreement

## Back to psychology...
The Demand/Withdraw Dance

### Sometimes you just have different opinions
- Diverse opinions are good
- Acknowledge others' points of view and motivations, even if they differ from yours
- Good leaders make it safe to voice and opinion

### When you Disagree, remember your ABCs
**Agree.** Start by finding the points where you agree.
**Build.** Use the points of agreement as a foundation to build the relationship.
**Compare.** Work together to examine the areas of disagreement and compare both perspectives. You may not always find solutions, but you will gain understanding and build relationships.
