### Communication Style is Important
We form unconscious opinions about people based on their communication styles.

- Accent
- Culture
- Pitch of voice
- Speed and pacing
- Pausing to allow others to speak

We tend to like people with communication styles similar to our own.

“Many of our motives, so obvious to us,
are never perceived by the people we talk to.
Many instances of rudeness, stubbornness, inconsiderateness, or refusal to cooperate are really caused by differences in conversational style.”

~ Deborah Tannen

## Tools for Communication about Problems
### Effective communication requires **shared context**

### Ability problems
- "I can't do this"
  - Lack of resources
  - Lack of knowledge
  - Lack of skills
  - Lack of experience
- Avoid misdiagnosis
  - Do not assume you understand the source of the problem
  - Ask for ideas
  - Listen carefully - is this truly an ability problem?
  - Work collaboratively to identify a solution

### Effective communication requires **shared motivation**
