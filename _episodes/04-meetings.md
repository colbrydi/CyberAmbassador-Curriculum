### Meeting Participants and Roles
**Who should attend?**
- People who have information
- People who need information
- People who make decisions
- People who are impacted by decisions

**Key roles for effective meetings**
- Facilitator
- Notetaker
- Timekeeper

### Facilitator
**Start by reviewing the agenda and asking if there are any changes**

- Allows the facilitator to gather new information
- Encourages participants to "buy in" to the agenda

**Move through the agenda items**

- Assign timekeeper and note taker (rotate the assignments)
- Encourage discussion and input
- Keep the meeting on track

### Notetaker
- Record attendance
- Summarize discussions
- Record key information
- Record decisions
  - What was decided
  - Implementation plans (next actions)
  - Responsible parties
  - Deadlines / timelines
- Use the agenda as a guideline
- Submit notes promptly after meeting

### Timekeeper
- Watch the clock
- Notify the facilitator when items run over time

### Ending Meetings Effectively
- When possible, end on a positive
  - Fun / creative activity
  - Brainstorming
  - “Shout outs”
- Review all decisions and action items
  - Who is responsible?
  - What needs to be done?
  - What is the deadline or timeline?

## Keeping meetings on task
- Unrelated Distractions (Squirrels)
- Related Distractions (Acorns)
- Emotional Distractions

### Squirrel!
**What do you do when a meeting gets off track because participants are discussing something unrelated to the meeting goals?**
1. Acknowledge that we are off track
2. Guide participants back to the agenda

**Keys to Handling Squirrels Effectively**
- Be subtle
- Be kind
- Focus on the goal, not the distraction

### Squirrel Example
You are in a research meeting and the agenda item is about the presentations your group will make at an upcoming conference.  Some meeting participants feel strongly that all of the group’s presentations should use the same slide designs and structure so that it’s easy for audience members to see the connections between your group’s presentations.  Other participants think that using different designs gives more flexibility to explain the different projects in the formats that are most appropriate to the individual topics.  Somehow, the meeting gets off track when Chris starts talking about a seven day bike trip in the mountains.

**What do you say to get the meeting back on track?**

### Acorn?!
**What do you do when a meeting gets off track, but the discussion IS related to the meeting goals?**
1. Acknowledge that we have identified a new item
2. Decide what to do with this new item
  - If you want to talk about it now, then adjust the agenda
  - If you want to talk about it later, pick a time and place
**Keys to Handling Acorns Effectively**
- Pause the discussion
- Acknowledge the new item
- Facilitate a decision about how to handle it
