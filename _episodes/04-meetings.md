## Key Components for Effective Meetings
- Agendas
- Participants and Roles
- Ending Meetings

### Developing Effective Agendas
**Before the meeting***
- Ask for input on agenda items
- Send a written agenda to participants

**When writing and agenda**
- Include time limits
- List the people responsible for each item
- Structure items encourage efficiency
  - Place items involving visitors at the start
  - Place urgent items first
  - Place lengthy items in the middle
  - Place creative or fun items last

### Meeting Participants and Roles
**Who should attend?**
- People who have information
- People who need information
- People who make decisions
- People who are impacted by decisions

**Key roles for effective meetings**
- Facilitator
- Notetaker
- Timekeeper

### Facilitator
**Start by reviewing the agenda and asking if there are any changes**

- Allows the facilitator to gather new information
- Encourages participants to "buy in" to the agenda

**Move through the agenda items**

- Assign timekeeper and note taker (rotate the assignments)
- Encourage discussion and input
- Keep the meeting on track

### Notetaker
- Record attendance
- Summarize discussions
- Record key information
- Record decisions
  - What was decided
  - Implementation plans (next actions)
  - Responsible parties
  - Deadlines / timelines
- Use the agenda as a guideline
- Submit notes promptly after meeting

### Timekeeper
- Watch the clock
- Notify the facilitator when items run over time

### Ending Meetings Effectively
- When possible, end on a positive
  - Fun / creative activity
  - Brainstorming
  - “Shout outs”
- Review all decisions and action items
  - Who is responsible?
  - What needs to be done?
  - What is the deadline or timeline?

## Keeping meetings on task
- Unrelated Distractions (Squirrels)
- Related Distractions (Acorns)
- Emotional Distractions

### Squirrel!
**What do you do when a meeting gets off track because participants are discussing something unrelated to the meeting goals?**
1. Acknowledge that we are off track
2. Guide participants back to the agenda

**Keys to Handling Squirrels Effectively**
- Be subtle
- Be kind
- Focus on the goal, not the distraction

### Squirrel Example
You are in a research meeting and the agenda item is about the presentations your group will make at an upcoming conference.  Some meeting participants feel strongly that all of the group’s presentations should use the same slide designs and structure so that it’s easy for audience members to see the connections between your group’s presentations.  Other participants think that using different designs gives more flexibility to explain the different projects in the formats that are most appropriate to the individual topics.  Somehow, the meeting gets off track when Chris starts talking about a seven day bike trip in the mountains.

**What do you say to get the meeting back on track?**

### Acorn?!
**What do you do when a meeting gets off track, but the discussion IS related to the meeting goals?**
1. Acknowledge that we have identified a new item
2. Decide what to do with this new item
  - If you want to talk about it now, then adjust the agenda
  - If you want to talk about it later, pick a time and place

**Keys to Handling Acorns Effectively**
- Pause the discussion
- Acknowledge the new item
- Facilitate a decision about how to handle it

### Acorn Example
You are meeting with a multidisciplinary team to discuss a proposal to use a new learning algorithm (developed by the computer scientists) to analyze hundreds of hours of video data of surgical techniques (collected by the biomedical engineers).  You are there because of your expertise in data management techniques and working with large data sets.  During the meeting, it becomes apparent that this project is going to generate an enormous amount of data that needs to be shared between systems and stored for long periods of time.  You’re not sure that current hardware and software setup on campus can support a project of this size, and you think that it might be necessary to explore regional or national resources.

**What do you say when this new information arises?**

### Emotion
**What do you do when strong emotions emerge
in the middle of a meeting?**
1. Acknowledge the individual(s)
2. Determine the underlying concern
3. Decide whether you can continue with the agenda, or not

**Keys to Handling Emotions Effectively**
1. Pause the discussion
2. Remain calm
3. Be kind and empathetic, without escalating the situation

### PEARLS for Acknowledging Emotion
- Partnership:
  - “I really want to work on this with you.”
  - “I bet we can figure this out together.”
- Empathy:
  - “I can feel your enthusiasm as you talk.”
  - “I can hear your concern.”
- Acknowledgement:
  - “You clearly put a lot of work into this.”
  - “You invested in this, and it shows.”
- Respect:
  - “I’ve always appreciated your creativity.”
  - “There’s no doubt you know a lot about this.”
- Legitimation:
  - “This would be hard for anyone.”
  - “Who wouldn’t be worried about something like this?”
- Support:
  - “I’d like to help you with this.”
  - “I want to see you succeed.”

### Emotion Example
You are facilitating a general meeting between HPC system administrators and users, where they are announcing plans to switch from a PBS-based scheduler to a SLURM-based scheduler.  The speaker puts up a slide showing a three month transition timeline, and a very prominent faculty member immediately stands up and interrupts loudly: “This is completely unreasonable!  I’ve been using PBS for over 10 years and my entire workflow is based on that system.  My research center has a 2 million dollar grant and we can’t afford a three month derailment.”  The faculty member is clearly emotional, and the speaker feels on the spot.

**As the facilitator, what do you say to the faculty member?**
