## First Contact: Teams

# Tuckman's Team Model
Tuckman, B. W. (1965). Developmental sequence in small groups. Psychological Bulletin, 63(6), 384-399.[http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0022100](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0022100)

# Conflict vs. Effectiveness

# Ice Breakers
- Help facilitate first contact in teams.
- Can help get groups bast the “forming” stage
- Should only be included with a purpose

## Exercise - Three Things
Write three statements about yourself
- Two should be true
- One should be false but possible
- All should say something about you

These will be shared
- Do not embarrass yourself of anyone else!

## First Contact: Networking

# Why is Networking Difficult?
- Schopenhauer’s Dilemma (the Porcupine Problem)
  - Porcupines huddle together for warmth, but move apart because their quills are sharp
  - Likewise, humans need community, but we also crave independence

# Independence vs. involvement
- Individual variations
  - Extroverted vs. introverted
  - Levels of experience and expertise
  - Language(s) and discipline(s)
- Cultural and societal variations
  - Power structures
  - Values and memes (cultural “genes”)
  - Perceptions of race, religion, age, gender, education, socioeconomic class, etc.

# The Power of Good Stories
"The way you talk about yourself is very powerful.
Whether or not you are conscious of it,
the way you tell stories of your life frames how people see you, and how you see yourself." ~ Penelope Trunk

# Think About the Content
- Personal
  - Who are we?
  - Where did we come from?
  - What are our values?
  - What are our goals?
- Professional
  - What do we do?
  - Why is it important?
  - How do we contribute?
  - What do we want to do next?

# Think About the Context
- Professional Events
  - Conferences
  - Seminars
  - Classes
  - Research group meetings
  - “Consulting” and collaborating
- Social and Community Activities
  - Parties and gatherings
  - Shopping and services
  - School events and extracurricular activities
  - Religious and cultural celebrations

# Crafting a Memorable Story
The challenge plot: you overcame an obstacle to get to where you are
- Original: “I’m really good at customer-focused service.”
- Upgrade: “I learned customer service working at an ice cream stand. In the summer the line was twenty people deep and it was a challenge to keep the customers happy.”

The creativity plot: the turning point in the story is a eureka moment – when an idea comes to you and changes everything
- Original: “My business is about selling textbooks.”
- Upgrade: “I had an idea to sell textbooks, but I couldn’t figure out how to market them as interesting to the consumer. Then it hit me that no one has a favorite textbook, but everyone has a favorite professor. So I needed to use the professors to hook in the customers.”

The connection plot: when you are telling a story about bringing a team together
- Original: “Our toy company merged with another toy company and people were duplicating each others’ efforts.”
- Upgrade: “After our toy company merged with a competitor, I convinced the teams to combine designs and work together. We created a doll that dominated the collectible doll market that Christmas.”

# Developing Your "Elevator Pitch"
Where: in what types of situations might you tell your story?
What: what are your key messages? What is most important to share?
How: practice! Aim for a natural delivery, without sounding over rehearsed.
Time: one minute or less! Your polished story should be short and memorable.
